# Rendering cheap shadows with Godot 3.x

This **work-in-progress** demo project showcases various cheap shadow methods that
work with both the GLES3 and GLES2 renderers:

- Blob shadows.
- Fake stencil shadows using scaled MeshInstance.
- Fake shadow maps using a ViewportTexture applied on a plane.
